# MultiUserbot
You can use this userbot to automate a lot of things.

# Getting started
##### You need to have python 3.5 or higher (3.7 / 3.8 suggested)

- Clone this repository (or download the zip and unzip it)
> git clone https://github.com/GodSaveTheDoge/MultiUserbot.git
- Change directory
> cd MultiUserbot
- Install libraries
> pip install -r requirements.txt
- Go to [Telegram api page](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and get your api id and api hash
- Open config.ini with your favourite editor and put your api id and api hash (line 2 and 3)
- Run the bot
> python main.py 


# Common error
One of the most common errors is caused by the wrong version of python. Please check with `python -V` the version you have installed.
(Before trying to install another version of python try using `python3` instead of `python` and `python3 -m pip` instead of `pip`)

# Note
This code is still buggy and not optimized at all, I'm still developing this.
I'd suggest to wait until a "stable" release.
